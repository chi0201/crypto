# crypto
Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/crypto

A couple of years ago I was curious how certain types of encryption and hashing worked.
I tried to implement some of the algoritms myself and this project is the result.

Please note that this code is only meant to provide an idea of how the algorims work.
They are in no way full feature, tested or supported!
