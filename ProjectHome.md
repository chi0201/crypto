Collection of encryption and hashing algorithms and ciphers.

I have moved from C/C++ to a C# version over at: http://code.google.com/p/cryptocs/

This project was for educational purposes and is currently no longer under development.
While I did my best to get these algorithms right, I can not guarantee their correctness at this point.

From my own comparison tests MD5 and SHA1 hash algorithms are working fine.
RSA logic is implemented, but still needs to be made usable by means of a big number library.
(3)DES is currently not functional in any way, unless you need it to corrupt a file or produce random garbage.

If you would like to take over ownership of this project, please contact me.
